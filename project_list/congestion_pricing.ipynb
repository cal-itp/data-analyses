Examples of Adaptive Traffic Management strategies include bus only lanes or modified lane configurations during peak travel times. Through improved operations of basin entry roads, user satisfaction improves, congestion decreases, transit use increases, and impacts to the environment (including GHG emissions) are expected to decrease.   \n",
