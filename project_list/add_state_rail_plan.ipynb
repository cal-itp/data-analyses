The funding will allow for the design and construction of a second ADA compliant platform, a new shelter for the second platform, and will refurbish the existing platform and shelter.  The project also includes the addition of a pedestrian underpass that will allow passenger to access the new platform safely. Also included will be the construction of a second set of tracks and two power switches to allow train operation on both platforms.   \n",

There are currently two (2) existing sidings within the project area, the South Pollock, and South Sacramento Sidings. The project will construct 1.3 miles of new track to connect each of the existing sidings and upgrade the siding switches and the line and surface of the tracks to increase speeds. The project will require relocating 13 metal utility poles. The connection of the sidings will allow ACE to run up to four (4) trains to Natomas increasing the transportation options for residents throughout the corridor. The project is located on the UPRR Sacramento Subdivision from MP 132.8 to MP 134.1.   \n",

A new crossover will need to be constructed west of the existing wye. Existing ties will be replaced with concrete ties. New control points will be installed. Grade crossings will need to be upgraded to meet quiet zone requirements. A drainage system that includes grading and new catch basins may be necessary pending further preliminary investigation.   \n",

The funding will allow for the design and construction of a second ADA compliant platform, a new shelter for the second platform, and will refurbish the existing platform and shelter.  The project also includes the addition of a pedestrian underpass that will allow passenger to access the new platform safely. Also included will be the construction of a second set of tracks and two power switches to allow train operation on both platforms.   \n",

There are currently two (2) existing sidings within the project area, the South Pollock, and South Sacramento Sidings. The project will construct 1.3 miles of new track to connect each of the existing sidings and upgrade the siding switches and the line and surface of the tracks to increase speeds. The project will require relocating 13 metal utility poles. The connection of the sidings will allow ACE to run up to four (4) trains to Natomas increasing the transportation options for residents throughout the corridor. The project is located on the UPRR Sacramento Subdivision from MP 132.8 to MP 134.1.   \n",

A new crossover will need to be constructed west of the existing wye. Existing ties will be replaced with concrete ties. New control points will be installed. Grade crossings will need to be upgraded to meet quiet zone requirements. A drainage system that includes grading and new catch basins may be necessary pending further preliminary investigation.   \n",
