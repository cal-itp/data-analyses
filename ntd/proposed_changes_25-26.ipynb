I’m not sure which ones these would be because the rulemaking wouldn’t affect all reporters. I’m also not sure what data wouldn’t be reported as a result. Is this something the analyst team can look into further… ie see if the proposed change in Section G would affect any California agencies and what data we may not receive from NTD as a result.\n",

I am not sure if there would be data loss based on FTA’s assessment that these agencies were historically Rural reporters."
