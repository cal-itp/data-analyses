# Addtional Transit Performance Metrics

In 2023, UCLA Institue of Transportation Studies published a white paper titled ["Options for the Future of State Funding for Transit Operations in CaliforniaInforming the Future of the Transportation Development Act"](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2zb6z5rm)

UCLA concluded that current transit performance metrics like "farebox recovery ratios" are:

>a cost-effectiveness metric currently applied as “one size fits all” in the TDA.
>
>As transit has two divergent and context-sensitive goals 
>    1. Efficiency in transit-oriented markets and 
>    2. Effectiveness in transit-dependent ones 
>
> tailoring metrics to match these market opportunities would likely result in managerial actions that would eventually increase ridership.

The paper continues on to propose the use of other common metrics used in transportation management. Also explains how each metrics:

>[has] different implicit goals, which makes some metrics better for use in some areas than others.

| Metric type          | Metric example                  | Implicit Goal(s)                       | Advantages                                   | Limitations                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Cost-efficiency      | Operating cost per revenue hour | Reduce costs*                         | Useful in both financial and service planning | Favors high labor productivity in dense, congested areas; does not track use |
|                      | Operating cost per revenue mile |                                       |                                              |                                              |
|                      | Operating cost per vehicle trip |                                       |                                              |                                              |
| Service-effectiveness| Passengers per revenue-vehicle hour | Increase ridership; reduce poorly patronized service | Useful for service planning; emphasizes what matters to riders | Favors high ridership; does not track costs   |
|                      | Passengers per revenue-vehicle mile | Increase ridership; reduce low-ridership route miles/segments | Useful for service planning                | Favors high ridership and fast vehicle speeds; does not track costs |
| Cost-effectiveness   | Farebox recovery ratio           | Reduce costs; increase fares; increase ridership | Commonly used; easy to calculate             | Combines both cost-efficiency and service-effectiveness into a single measure; difficult to deconstruct and interpret |


This report intends to explores these metrics with data submitted to the NTD for all reporters in California.

## Who We Are
 

This website was created by the [California Department of Transportation](https://dot.ca.gov/)'s Division of Data and Digital Services. We are a group of data analysts and scientists who analyze transportation data, such as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, or data from funding programs such as the Active Transportation Program. Our goal is to transform messy and indecipherable original datasets into usable, customer-friendly products to better the transportation landscape. For more of our work, visit our [portfolio](https://analysis.calitp.org/).
