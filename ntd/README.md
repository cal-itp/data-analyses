# NTD Monthly Ridership by RTPA

Provide CalSTA with NTD Monthly Ridership sorted by regional transportation planning authority (RTPA). One spreadsheet per RTPA.

NTD monthly data: https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release. 

Hopefully this is the canonical [RTPA list](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CAEnergy::regional-transportation-planning-agencies/explore?appid=cf412a17daaa47bca93c6d6b7e77aff0&edit=true) by Caltrans
   * SCAG is the only RTPA...though we think LA Metro is the RTPA for LA County?
