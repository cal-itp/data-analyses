    "## Target Ridership\n",
    "\n",

    "Second we need to calculate the number of riders per additional trip so that we can determine what an equivalent service increase would be to guarantee the same ridership increase that open loop does. The number of additional riders can be calculated as existing ridership multiplied by percentage increase of ridership per additional trip added.\n",
