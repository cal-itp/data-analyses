# README

For analysis, there's probably a set of steps in data cleaning or data visualization that we do repeatedly. We encounter them both within a research question and across research questions. Why reinvent the wheel?

Document these shared utility functions to standardize and make it easier for analysts to run these data cleaning or data visualization steps. The utility functions would be importable across all directories in the `data-analyses` repo and can be called within a Jupyter notebook or Python script.
