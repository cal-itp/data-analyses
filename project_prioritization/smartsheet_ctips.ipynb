Proposed improvements will enhance safety, reduce congestion, improve travel time delays and optimize freeway system management.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project will increase efficiency of the transportation system, improve travel time reliability for all users, optimize freeway system management and traffic operations, improve safety and maintain consistency with California Streets and Highway Code Section 149.5 to implement HOV/Express lanes system in Alameda County, and close the 9-mile gap between existing or in-construction HOV/express lane segments.</td>\n",

The Project reduces congestion, increases truck throughput, and eliminates a bottleneck for trucks accessing I-580, a key freight highway. The Project will improve interregional goods movement for trucks traveling between the Port of Oakland, Bay Area, local warehouses, Southern California, and out-of-state.   \n",

The scope of this project is for Phase 1. The corridor will be a high capacity bypass around the cities of Modesto, Riverbank and Oakdale as shown in Exhibit 1. The Phase 1 project will be an ultimate 6-lane divided expressway beginning at the intersection of Claribel Road & Oakdale Road, extending eastward to the intersection of Claribel Road & Claus Road. It will be access controlled with a 40’-70’ median with grade separations over Roselle Avenue, Terminal Avenue and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad tracks. This new alignment will build a west-east expressway that will improve regional network circulation connecting from the western end of downtown Modesto to the eastward end joining SR-120 east of the City of Oakdale (Segments 1 to 4).   \n",

The proposed bridge would accommodate for SLR under the medium-high or 2130 H++ SLR scenario. Includes removing rock slope protection. Dune, lagoon, and marsh habitat restoration to more natural state. Building longer/higher bridge to accommodate the natural flow of Scotts Creek, storm surge, and a 100-year flood event. Bike/ped path (California Coastal Trail). Interpretive displays with viewing scopes. Drainage improvements. ZEV car and bike charging stations in the southern parking lot. This project may not be purely a climate change project, but does include quite a few adaptation elements that will make the area more resilient to climate change.   \n",

The proposed multi-purpose path will extend along the north side of Decoto Road through the interchange, also between the Decoto Road/Cabrillo Court intersection and the southbound I-880 off-ramp.   \n",
       "38321  Convert the facility from 2 lanes to 4-lanes with a raised median, turning lanes, and eight-foot shoulders between I-15 and SR-18, a distance of approximately 7 miles. The first segment between State Route 18 and Chamberlaine Way was completed in 2020. This proposed next phase of construction will eliminate the two-lane freight bottleneck between I-15 and the four-lanes north of SR-18, better enabling the corridor to accommodate the estimated 5000 trucks per day utilizing this segment connecting the eastern Sierras and Central Valley (via SR-58) with the Inland Empire. An eight-foot paved shoulder will also be added, providing an additional buffer between traffic and bicycles/pedestrians. The current shoulder is generally four feet in width.\\nThis project is located on US 395 between SR-18 (Palmdale Rd) and I-15 in the Cities of Hesperia and Victorville.  \\nDescription: The project will widen sections of US 395 from two to four lanes between SR-18 (Palmdale Rd) and I-15 in the Cities of Hesperia and Victorville.  Proposed improvements also include a continuous 14-foot paved median, 8-foot shoulders, operational enhancements such as adding left and/or right turn channelization, signal interconnection, and signal upgrades at intersections.\\n7 - intersection/signal improvements\\n14 - turn pockets constructed\\n14.4 miles - new roadway lane\\n1 SQFT - modified reconstructed bridge/tunnel   \n",

The project runs along Hearn Avenue from Corby Avenue to Santa Rosa Avenue and includes the southbound US 101 off-ramp at its intersection with Corby Avenue. The project will demolish and reconstruct/replace the US 101/Hearn Avenue overcrossing to increase vertical clearance over US 101 and provide two vehicle lanes in each direction, a median, sidewalks, and Class II and Class IV bikeways that will extend to Corby Avenue and Santa Rosa Avenue. The project will also widen the southbound US 101 off-ramp with turning lanes at its intersection with Corby Avenue, add lanes at the intersections of Hearn Avenue/Corby Avenue and Hearn Avenue/Santa Rosa Avenue, and add ADA  elements and protected intersection facilities for bike crossings and detection to reduce potential conflicts between bikes and vehicles.</td>\n",

       "99510  Convert the facility from 2 lanes to 4-lanes with a raised median, turning lanes, and eight-foot shoulders between I-15 and SR-18, a distance of approximately 7 miles. The first segment between State Route 18 and Chamberlaine Way was completed in 2020. This proposed next phase of construction will eliminate the two-lane freight bottleneck between I-15 and the four-lanes north of SR-18, better enabling the corridor to accommodate the estimated 5000 trucks per day utilizing this segment connecting the eastern Sierras and Central Valley (via SR-58) with the Inland Empire. An eight-foot paved shoulder will also be added, providing an additional buffer between traffic and bicycles/pedestrians. The current shoulder is generally four feet in width.\\nThis project is located on US 395 between SR-18 (Palmdale Rd) and I-15 in the Cities of Hesperia and Victorville.  \\nDescription: The project will widen sections of US 395 from two to four lanes between SR-18 (Palmdale Rd) and I-15 in the Cities of Hesperia and Victorville.
