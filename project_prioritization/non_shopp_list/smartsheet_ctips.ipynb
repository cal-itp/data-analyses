The project consists of the construction of a two-lane expressway from Green Sands Avenue (northern terminus of AME Phase 1A) to Sante Fe Drive.  The project includes two at-grade intersections, an overcrossing of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Drive, and bridge structures over waterways.  With the overcrossing, the project will eliminate the unsafe, at-grade crossing at Avenue Two and Santa Fe Drive.  The project will provide direct SR-99 connection to the Mid-California International Trade District (MCITD)-Castle.   \n",

The Project will widen Route 101 to construct a southbound HOV lane from 0.3 miles south of the Marin/Sonoma County line to just south of the Franklin Avenue Overhead (6.0 miles), and a northbound HOV lane from 1.7 miles north of the Atherton Avenue Overcrossing to 0.3 miles south of the Marin/Sonoma County line (3.5 miles). The Project includes roadway and bridge widening for HOV lanes and standard shoulders. The Project will also upgrade the horizontal and vertical roadway alignment (for a 70 mph design speed), modify the Redwood Landfill Interchange ramps to conform with the new alignment, and restripe a frontage road (Redwood Boulevard) for Class II bike lanes in Novato.   \n",

       "10394  Convert the facility from 2 lanes to 4-lanes with a raised median, turning lanes, and eight-foot shoulders between I-15 and SR-18, a distance of approximately 7 miles. The first segment between State Route 18 and Chamberlaine Way was completed in 2020. This proposed next phase of construction will eliminate the two-lane freight bottleneck between I-15 and the four-lanes north of SR-18, better enabling the corridor to accommodate the estimated 5000 trucks per day utilizing this segment connecting the eastern Sierras and Central Valley (via SR-58) with the Inland Empire. An eight-foot paved shoulder will also be added, providing an additional buffer between traffic and bicycles/pedestrians. The current shoulder is generally four feet in width.\\nThis project is located on US 395 between SR-18 (Palmdale Rd) and I-15 in the Cities of Hesperia and Victorville.  \\nDescription: The project will widen sections of US 395 from two to four lanes between SR-18 (Palmdale Rd) and I-15 in the Cities of Hesperia and Victorville.
