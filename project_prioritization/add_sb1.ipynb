This project will include 3.2 miles of Class I bike, path greenway, and pedestrian path (as feasible), along the LA river between Whitsett Ave to Lankershim Blvd, which will also include five (5) at grade crossings at, and four (4) at grade crossings located at Whitsett Ave, Laurel Canyon Blvd, and Tujunga Ave, as well as two (2) bridges located at Radford Ave/over the Tujunga Wash as and a pedestrian bridge over the LA River. Class IV bike path on Whitsett, Radford, and Vineland will be constructed and approximately 0.45 miles of Class III bike path on Laurel Grove leading to the River will be constructed. This project will also try to upgrade to the maximum extent feasible the Vineland Ave corridor from Whipple to San Fernando Road, which stretches approximately 5 miles. These upgrades include putting in bollards along buffer areas and painting conflict zones. Other scope includes lighting, bioswales, retaining walls (as needed), and other pedestrian amenities, such as bike racks, benches, trash cans, and pet waste stations, and pedestrian enhancements.</td>\n",

       "345  This project will construct at least 4.65 miles of high-quality bicycle infrastructure and pedestrian enhancements along the LA River and through the east San Fernando Valley, providing a safe and continuous active transportation network that will expand non-auto commute options increase access to high-quality transit lines and employment hubs, and improve access to recreation for LA residents and visitors. This project will include 3.2 miles of Class I bike, path greenway, and pedestrian path (as feasible), along the LA river between Whitsett Ave to Lankershim Blvd, which will also include five (5) at grade crossings at, and four (4) at grade crossings located at Whitsett Ave, Laurel Canyon Blvd, and Tujunga Ave, as well as two (2) bridges located at Radford Ave/over the Tujunga Wash as and a pedestrian bridge over the LA River. Class IV bike path on Whitsett, Radford, and Vineland will be constructed and approximately 0.45 miles of Class III bike path on Laurel Grove leading to the River will be constructed. This project will also try to upgrade to the maximum extent feasible the Vineland Ave corridor from Whipple to San Fernando Road, which stretches approximately 5 miles. These upgrades include putting in bollards along buffer areas and painting conflict zones. Other scope includes lighting, bioswales, retaining walls (as needed), and other pedestrian amenities, such as bike racks, benches, trash cans, and pet waste stations, and pedestrian enhancements.   \n",
