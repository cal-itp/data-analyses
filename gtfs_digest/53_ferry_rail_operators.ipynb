    "Tiffany's comment:\n",
    "If it's just a couple of rail, (Amtrak, Metrolink) and a handful of ferry operators, it's worth digging into the why they dropped off, and start by looking for their rows in the 4 schedule tables: trips, shapes, stops, stop_times, and then look for it in a vp table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I think the ferry operators and Metrolink are already associated to a district. Even Amtrak might be? But if Amtrak isn't, you can create a separate \"district = Amtrak\" the merged df so it always has a tab for itself. Amtrak plots for the entire country!\n",
    "* District 4: San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), City and County of San Francisco (Muni)\n",
    "* District 7: Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro)\n",
    "* District 11: San Diego Metropolitan Transit System\n",
    "\n",
    "Amanda\n",
    "* All the ferry operators are gone. \n",
    "* Amtrak is in District 3 but it has schedule_only data, which isn't true? \n",
    "\n",
    "Other operators (thanks Meta.AI)\n",
    "* Strikethroughs = these operators are already in our `schd_vp_df2`\n",
