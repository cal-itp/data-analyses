## Meeting notes 11/13/2024
timestamps
still finding buses that are genuinely 12 hours late
found a better way to deal with the time stamps
sorting
shape_array_key switches for routes - VTA light rail example 
arguments for not grouping on shape - short/longlining 
Can light rail bunch? if it's at grade, possibly 
sidebar - do we want to separate services/modes/route types for the agencies that provide both in speedmaps/gtfs digest? maybe? 
try ditching shape_array_key
question about delay >2hrs
do we need delay?
Amanda trying to throw out rows but we probably don't need to
transit matters method does use scheduled arrival lag 
if we get the headway expectation for a general time period, then we don't need specific delay 
using "all day" time period off Tiffany's data - we should change this to a more stable period ("peak") 
60/frequency [trips/hr] = headway
visualizations
hour x minute scatterplot 
could also put background grey dots that are evenly spaced showing the scheduled arrivals
