    "i added a script that i think is more helpful for your operator data, like aggregating to the portfolio name / handling ntd stuff, then filtering to the most recent date and saving it out. that way, you can just pull that table in your notebook.\n",
    "i also took a pass at removing what looked like entries in the yml that had duplicative data, so fingers crossed, the datasets created in https://github.com/cal-itp/data-analyses/blob/5cf1083a9cafdf6c1068258762b2f6c19d7ba377/gtfs_digest/aggregate_filter_operator_data.py will be what you can use directly in the notebook.\n",

    "5/21\n",
    "But one of the columns I thought was useful for operator grain was taking the mode of the sched_rt_category per date from route direction file, and then attaching it to the operator grain. That can be used for the yaml (both deploy to get your list of operators) and for detecting errors\n",
