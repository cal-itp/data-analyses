# Starter Kit Portfolio
I am revamping some of our exercises and one exercise will teach future analysts how to make a portfolio. Yay!

## Who We Are
We want our audience to understand who we are and why our expertise and research should be trusted. Here is a blurb you can lift. 

This website was created by the [California Department of Transportation](https://dot.ca.gov/)'s Division of Data and Digital Services. We are a group of data analysts and scientists who analyze transportation data, such as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, or data from funding programs such as the Active Transportation Program. Our goal is to transform messy and indecipherable original datasets into usable, customer-friendly products to better the transportation landscape. For more of our work, visit our [portfolio](https://analysis.calitp.org/).
