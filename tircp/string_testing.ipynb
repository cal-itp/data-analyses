Includes service extension to Oxnard, and development of layover facilities that can host expanded zero-emission bus service in the future.  The proposed investment will lead to significant rider travel time reductions once the HOV lanes are completed. Current estimates expect a 45-minute round trip travel time reduction for passenger using these buses, and the ridership gain from this improved travel time will further expand the greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits of the project. This project also provides geographic diversity to the state’s transit investments.\\nCounty: Santa Barbara\\n   \n",
