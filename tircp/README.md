# TIRCP 
**TIRCP**, The Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program (TIRCP) was created by Senate Bill (SB) 862 (Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014) and modified by 9 (Chapter 710, Statutes of 2015), to provide grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to fund transformative capital improvements that will modernize Californiaâ€™s intercity, commuter, and urban rail systems, and bus and ferry transit systems to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, vehicle miles traveled, and congestion.

5. [Sb1 GIS](./request_sb1_gis_template.ipynb): Populating SB1 GIS template using TIRCP that is used to create [this map](http://rebuildingca.ca.gov/map/). 

###  Scripts:
TIRCP scripts are based entirely on TIRCP Tracking Sheet 2.0 which is an Excel Workbook. The workbook is uploaded to GCS amd is saved as TIRCP_10-31-2022.xlsx with the updated date in the filename. 

<b>Before running the scripts</b>: open the Workbook and delete row 1:6 which are the header rows.

1. [Data Prep](./A1_data_prep.py): Cleans the sheets (allocation, project, GIS, and invoice) in the TIRCP workbook before creating other reports & the Excel file that feeds into Tableau. This file also contains functions used across this project. 
    * Replace FILE_NAME at the top with the latest file name. 
    * Run and follow the instructions in [this notebook](./script_manual.ipynb). The `Allocation` and `Project` sheets of the TIRCP workbook have areas that need to be manually looked over. The notebook does the following: 
        * Ensure PPNO numbers are unique to every project in the "Project Sheet." Sometimes projects are under different names in different cycles. There are 96 projects in total, as of writing.
        * Make sure PPNO numbers match across the "Allocation" and "Project" Sheets using sets and lists.  
        * Dates in the "Allocation" sheet are read in correctly and manually correct them if they are not. 
2. [Tableau](./A2_tableau.py): Run the function `complete_tableau()` to return an Excel workbook that serves as the data source for the TIRCP Tableau dashboard. 
3. [Semiannual Report](./A3_semiannual_report.py): Run `create_sar_report()` to create the Semiannual Report prepared by TIRCP's coordinator.
4. [Program Allocation Plan Report](./A4_program_allocation_plan.py): Automates the Program Allocation Plan Report (an Excel workbook) that is submitted every few months.
5. [Crosswalks](./A5_crosswalks.py): Some portions of the manual cleaning up are located here. 
6. [Other](./A6_other.py): Functions for the requests/presentations, such as basic charting, searching for keywords in the project descriptions, and extracting numbers from the project descriptions.
