# TIRCP 
**TIRCP**, The Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program (TIRCP) was created by Senate Bill (SB) 862 (Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014) and modified by 9 (Chapter 710, Statutes of 2015), to provide grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to fund transformative capital improvements that will modernize Californiaâ€™s intercity, commuter, and urban rail systems, and bus and ferry transit systems to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, vehicle miles traveled, and congestion.

## Sections
### Ad-Hoc Requests/Presentations 
1. [CTC Presentation](./requests/Interim_Expenditures_Solution.ipynb): Prep for CTC presentation.
2. [Interim Expenditures](./requests/Interim_Expenditures_Solution.ipynb): Takes expenditures data from InfoAdvantage and merges it with the Project sheet in the TIRCP Tracking Sheet on Project ID. This was prepared for an internal presentation.

4. [Calsta](./request_calsta_tircp_outcomes.ipynb): Outcomes of TIRCP requested by Calsta's research team. 
5. [Sb1 GIS](./request_sb1_gis_template.ipynb): Populating SB1 GIS template using TIRCP that is used to create [this map](http://rebuildingca.ca.gov/map/). 

###  Scripts:
TIRCP work is based entirely on TIRCP Tracking Sheet 2.0 Excel Workbook in the GCS (saved as TIRCP_10-31-2022.xlsx with the updated date in the filename). 
1. [Data Prep](./A1_data_prep.py): Cleans the sheets (allocation, project, GIS, and invoice) in the TIRCP workbook before creating other reports & the Excel file that feeds into Tableau. This file also contains functions used across this project. Functions for cleaning each sheet can be broken apart by sections that manually clean the data by replacing values versus sections that don't require manual intervention. The manual portions require intervention when the workbook is updated: 
    * Ensure PPNO numbers are unique to every project in the "Project Sheet." As of writing, there are 5 cycles of projects and 96 projects. 
    * Make sure PPNO numbers match across the "Allocation" and "Project" Sheets using sets and lists.  
    * Dates in the "Allocation" sheet are read in correctly and manually correct them if they are not. 
2. [Tableau](./A2_tableau.py): Excel workbook that serves as the data source for the TIRCP Tableau dashboard. 
3. [Semiannual Report](./A3_semiannual_report.py): Automates the Semiannual Report prepared by TIRCP's coordinator. 
4. [Program Allocation Plan Report](./A4_program_allocation_plan.py): Automates the Program Allocation Plan Report that is submitted every few months.
5. [Crosswalks](./A5_crosswalks.py): There are manual portions of cleaning up this data and all the crosswalks are located here. 
6. [Other](./A6_other.py): Functions for the requests/presentations, such as basic charting, searching for keywords in the project descriptions, and extracting numbers from the project descriptions.
