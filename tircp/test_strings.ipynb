       "15  Complements rail service for commuters between Venture and Santa Barbara counties by enhancing bus services that will allow seamless use of both rail and transit service for commute to employment centers in the Santa Barbara area from Onard and Venture in Venture County with 5 zero-emission over-the-road electric buses. Includes service extension to Onard, and development of layer facilities that can host expanded zero-emission bus service in the future. The proposed investment will lead to significant rider travel time reductions once the HO lanes are completed. Current estimates expect a 45-minute round trip travel time reduction for passenger using these buses, and the ridership gain from this improved travel time will further expand the greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits of the project. This project also provides geographic diversity to the state’s transit investments. County: Santa Barbara   \n",
