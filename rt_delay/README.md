# rt_delay (rt_analysis) tooling

## Documentation

See docs site: https://docs.calitp.org/data-infra/analytics_tools/rt_analysis.html#example-workflow-sccp

## What's here?

* The `rt_analysis` package, which supports the California Transit Speed Maps and other analyses. Install with `make setup_rt_analysis`, and see the docs and the tutorial notebook for an intro.

* Various other notebooks from past analyses (ongoing workflows will be parameterized/documented/migrated as appropriate)

## Where are speedmaps and SCCP/LPP?

The `data_analyses/ca_transit_speed_maps` and `data_analyses/sccp` folders, respectively. See the technical notes in `ca_transit_speed_maps` for more info about the new scripted generation process.
