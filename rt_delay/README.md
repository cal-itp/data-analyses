# Legacy Speedmaps / `rt_analysis`

This codebase is no longer used to generate new data, but you can still use `rt_analysis/rt_filter_map_plot` to access speed datasets processed on select dates in the v1 warehouse.

## Where are speedmaps and SCCP/LPP?

The `data_analyses/ca_transit_speed_maps` and `data_analyses/sccp` folders, respectively. See the technical notes in `ca_transit_speed_maps` for more info about the new scripted generation process.
