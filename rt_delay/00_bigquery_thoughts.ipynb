Then the vehicle may be closest to points corresponding to two different time points along the trip route. Maybe for now we just pick one and hope it all averages out.\n",
    "* BigQuery doesn't have functions like [`ST_LineLocatePoint`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_LineLocatePoint.html), which would be sooooo ideal. Can we do a custom linear interpolation function? Should we rely on BigQuery [user-defined functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions)? And is the linear interpolation even necessary?\n",

    "  - Alternative simplification #2:\n",
    "    - This is hard in the first place because BigQuery doesn't have linear interpolation built in\n",
    "    - Pull data into Python and use Shapely?; but not real-time (i.e., we have to do the processing in Python on some schedule and then materialize the results in BigQuery as opposed to having a view ready). Also, BigQuery's good at parallelization.\n",
    "  - Best guess:\n",
    "    - Start with simplification #1. If custom linear interp function is not too onerous, or time distances are long enough where it's necessary, go with full linear interp method in a UDF."

    "In the results below, we see that 95% of arrival time differences from one stop to the next are under 3 minutes (180 seconds). And even for stop times with a larger gap than 180 seconds, 90% of those are less than 10 minutes. So, fewer than 0.5% of trips between stops take more than 10 minutes. From that, it seems reasonable to at least _start_ by using the closest stop location as opposed to closest position along a route. If necessary, we can generalize later."
