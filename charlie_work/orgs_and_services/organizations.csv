In 1975, the City of Santa Maria hired SMOOTH to develop and manage the new Santa Maria Area Transit public transit system. SMOOTH successfully operated the SMAT system for 27 years until 2003.

SMOOTH has also operated several local and regional transit services including the City of Guadalupe and the County Health Care Center Shuttle (SB Medical Van).

Under federal law, SCAG is designated as a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and under state law as a Regional Transportation Planning Agency and a Council of Governments.

The SCAG region encompasses six counties (Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura) and 191 cities in an area covering more than 38,000 square miles. The agency develops long-range regional transportation plans including sustainable communities strategy and growth forecast components, regional transportation improvement programs, regional housing needs allocations and a portion of the South Coast Air Quality management plans. In 1992, SCAG expanded its governing body, the Executive Committee, to a 70-member Regional Council to help accommodate new responsibilities mandated by the federal and state governments, as well as to provide more broad-based representation of Southern California’s cities and counties. With its expanded membership structure, SCAG created regional districts to provide for more diverse representation. The districts were formed with the intent to serve equal populations and communities of interest. Currently, the Regional Council consists of 86 members.",https://scag.ca.gov/,"Imperial County,Los Angeles County,Orange County,Riverside County,San Bernardino County,Ventura County",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,0,0,0,"Imperial,Los Angeles,Orange,Riverside,San Bernardino","Los Angeles,Orange,Riverside,Ventura,San Bernardino,Imperial",Static OK,RT Incomplete,,
