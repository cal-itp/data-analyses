Rebel responded with feedback from the first refactor. 
>Apologies for the delay on this; Zack flagged for me that you brought this to his attention and we have a few basic thoughts to offer in response!
> 
>•First, glad to see this come through; it’s a great start! It appears that this was quite some effort to gather data from disparate sources, which of course highlights the need for the type of efforts we’ve been discussing related to data sharing and asset management.
>
>•At the same time this is incomplete and just a window into the reality of all bus purchases; I expect we need easier access to structured data (e.g., more than press releases) and more visibility into other data sources. For example, we know most agencies aren’t purchasing off the DGS schedule, but rather the CALACT, Virginia, Washington, etc. contracts. I’m sure there are many ways to attack this, but we know data availability is the root of the challenge here (especially given that the largest group of data does not have a specified fuel type). 
>
>	**AGREED. THE LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA WITHIN THE ANALYSIS IS VERY APPARENT, AND NOT AS GRANULAR AS WE WOULD HOPE** 
>
>•The general findings in terms of average cost and relative costs between ZEB types is consistent with what we’ve seen (>$1M, FCEBs more expensive than BEBs, etc.). 
>
>•While the analysis does seem able to differentiate by bus size/type, this is a fairly large distortion in the analysis – mostly if smaller cutaways and vans are pooled with 30+ foot vehicles or in the “not specified” category. We would likely recommend explicitly separating vehicles out by size/type in all analysis to increase accuracy (and provide important data points for agencies for whom the smaller transit vehicles are crucial).
>
>	**SEPERATING OUT SIZE/TYPE SHOULD BE POSSIBLE, IF NOT ALREADY DONE IN THE LAST TABLE THAT BREAKSDOWN PROPULSION TYPE AND BUS SIZE** 
>
>•Helpful extensions/improvements might include:
>	- Clearer separation by bus type
>	- Providing time series data to be able to see >progression in prices over time 
>		○ **MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO, WILL HAVE TO REVIEW SORUCE >DATA FOR ANY TIME SEIRES DATA TYPES THAT ARE MOER GRANULAR THAN YEAR**
>	- Data by manufacturer 
>		○ **LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE BUT POSSIBLE** 
>	- Data by purchasing vehicle/contract 
>		○ **MIGHT BE POSSIBLE IF I CLARIFY IN THE INTRO THE >DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DATA SOURCES, EX DGS PURCHASE VS GRANT TIRCP OR FTA**
>	- In an ideal world, data showing key vehicle >specifications, to highlight key cost drivers (e.g., >extended battery range, customizations, etc.)
>		○ **ONLY THE DGS DATA ANYTHING RELATED LINE ITEM COST**
>
>•In general, this analysis does help highlight the very challenging data environment (and large information asymmetries for transit agencies). We have seen other analyses in space that have similar conclusions, so it is challenging to say if this brings great additional value. However, for example, if this analysis were easily replicable to be able to track prices over time, this could be a step in the right direction.

will work on addressing these items in another refactor
