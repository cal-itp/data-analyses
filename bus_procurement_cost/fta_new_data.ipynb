       "112  Purchase thirty 40-foot battery electric buses (BEBs) to replace thirty 60  hybrid diesel/electric buses that are beyond their FTA defined useful life benchmark.  The buses would support converting 27 routes that operate out of Metros South Base Campus to full zero emissions operations.  These routes serve areas which have a higher proportion of Black , Indigenous, and People of Color, and low-income populations than the rest of the County.  See Attachment 1b.The project also supports Metros Workforce and Pathways Development programs including: 1) Expands Metros 48-month registered apprenticeship programs (four new apprentices).  2) Expands supportive services to help purchase tools and provide dependent care (ten apprentices). 3) Provides inclusive community outreach events to promote career pathways targeting residents in underserved communities. 4) Includes train-the-trainer classes (15) for Metros Battery Electric Bus Training Academy to support advanced workforce training.   \n",

The buses will be assigned to mainline routes showcasing the project to citizens and visitors. PRIME will reduce: fossil fuel consumption, harmful emissions, dependence on foreign energy sources.   \n",
       "128           The Accelerate Clean Transit (ACT) Project will deploy 23 hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses (FCEB) and create an Advanced Transportation apprenticeship program in partnership with Palomar College. The project will replace 23 end-of-life compressed natural gas (CNG) buses with FCEBs and leverage local investment in workforce development and hydrogen fueling infrastructure to maximize and deploy resources to communities in need. Consistent with the Justice 40 Initiative, funding support from the FTA for this project will benefit Historically Disadvantaged Communities by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, increasing service reliability, and creating a pipeline of good-paying jobs. Through this funding support, a quarter of NCTD's fleet will be zero-emission by late 2024 (as opposed to the scheduled twenty percent), which would result in the modernization of energy consumption and improvement of air quality and transit operations in San Diego County.    \n",
