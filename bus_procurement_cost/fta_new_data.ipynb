These vehicles build upon RTC's long history as being an early adopter for alternative fueled vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells represents the next generation of zero-emission transit technologies and these buses, unlike traditional battery-electric, provide the solution for the longer operational ranges needed for coverage on all our transit routes and for faster refueling.  RTC's first hydrogen vehicles will be delivered and placed into service at the end of 2023.
