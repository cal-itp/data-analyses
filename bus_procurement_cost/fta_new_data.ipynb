The proposed project allows for an expansion of service frequency on one existing inter-community route connecting rural communities to the city of Merced. The route currently operates on limited frequency and is not enough to keep up with existing demand. The project also expands local service on one local route to provide better bus service to a developed residential area currently with limited access to service.   \n",
