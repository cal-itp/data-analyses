This project improves fleet reliability by reducing mechanic down time, create good-paying jobs in zero emission technology, modernize our campus and enable Mountain Line to meet growth assumptions that connect communities. Mountain Line completes all maintenance in-house and has high standards to maintain a state of good repair for all fleet, as demonstrated by the fact that Mountain Line has never had a maintenance finding in an FTA triennial review.

       "1  Funding supports the construction of the maintenance facility at our headquarters. Mountain Line has received $1,600,000 in a competitive FTA Arizona 5339/5307 grant for the design of this facility. The existing facility is not designed for 60 buses, only fitting half the bus inside and is not tall enough to safely perform work on batteries nor has the required electric outlets for electric buses. This project improves fleet reliability by reducing mechanic down time, create good-paying jobs in zero emission technology, modernize our campus and enable Mountain Line to meet growth assumptions that connect communities. Mountain Line completes all maintenance in-house and has high standards to maintain a state of good repair for all fleet, as demonstrated by the fact that Mountain Line has never had a maintenance finding in an FTA triennial review. This project takes a proactive approach to addressing maintenance issues to maintain our high standards for state of good repair.   \n",

       "      <td>The Accelerate Clean Transit (ACT) Project will deploy 23 hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses (FCEB) and create an Advanced Transportation apprenticeship program in partnership with Palomar College. The project will replace 23 end-of-life compressed natural gas (CNG) buses with FCEBs and leverage local investment in workforce development and hydrogen fueling infrastructure to maximize and deploy resources to communities in need. Consistent with the Justice 40 Initiative, funding support from the FTA for this project will benefit Historically Disadvantaged Communities by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, increasing service reliability, and creating a pipeline of good-paying jobs. Through this funding support, a quarter of NCTD's fleet will be zero-emission by late 2024 (as opposed to the scheduled twenty percent), which would result in the modernization of energy consumption and improvement of air quality and transit operations in San Diego County.</td>\n",

       "1   Purchase thirty 40-foot battery electric buses (BEBs) to replace thirty 60  hybrid diesel/electric buses that are beyond their FTA defined useful life benchmark.  The buses would support converting 27 routes that operate out of Metros South Base Campus to full zero emissions operations.  These routes serve areas which have a higher proportion of Black , Indigenous, and People of Color, and low-income populations than the rest of the County.  See Attachment 1b.The project also supports Metros Workforce and Pathways Development programs including: 1) Expands Metros 48-month registered apprenticeship programs (four new apprentices).  2) Expands supportive services to help purchase tools and provide dependent care (ten apprentices). 3) Provides inclusive community outreach events to promote career pathways targeting residents in underserved communities. 4) Includes train-the-trainer classes (15) for Metros Battery Electric Bus Training Academy to support advanced workforce training.   \n",

The buses will be assigned to mainline routes showcasing the project to citizens and visitors.

       "3            The Accelerate Clean Transit (ACT) Project will deploy 23 hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses (FCEB) and create an Advanced Transportation apprenticeship program in partnership with Palomar College. The project will replace 23 end-of-life compressed natural gas (CNG) buses with FCEBs and leverage local investment in workforce development and hydrogen fueling infrastructure to maximize and deploy resources to communities in need. Consistent with the Justice 40 Initiative, funding support from the FTA for this project will benefit Historically Disadvantaged Communities by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, increasing service reliability, and creating a pipeline of good-paying jobs. Through this funding support, a quarter of NCTD's fleet will be zero-emission by late 2024 (as opposed to the scheduled twenty percent), which would result in the modernization of energy consumption and improvement of air quality and transit operations in San Diego County.    \n",
