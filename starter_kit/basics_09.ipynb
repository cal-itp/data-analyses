    "# Exercise 9: series\n",
    "\n",
    "* pandas series vs numpy arrays [explanation](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.01-introducing-pandas-objects.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common series operations\n",
    "These are the most common series operations we use. Refer to the `pandas` docs for even more!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Getting dates, hours, minutes from datetime types (`df.datetime_col.dt.date`)\n",
    "* Parsing strings (`df.string_col.str.split('_')`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common geoseries operations\n",
    "These are the most common. Refer to the `geopandas` docs for even more!\n",
    "\n",
    "* `distance` between 2 points or a point to a polygon or line [docs](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.distance.html)\n",
    "* `intersects`: [docs](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.intersects.html)\n",
    "* `within`: [docs](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.within.html)\n",
    "* `contains`: [docs](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.contains.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we've often used geoseries methods without even realizing it. Often, we'd create a new column that stores either the line's length or a polygon's area. `gdf.geometry` is a geoseries, and we call methods on that geoseries, and add that as a new column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculations like `length`, `area`, and `distance`, we need to use a projected CRS that has units like meters or feet. We cannot use decimal degrees (do not use WGS 84 / `EPSG:4326`)! Distance calculations must be done only once the spherical 3D Earth has been converted into a 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `length`: get the length of a line (`gdf.geometry.length`)\n",
    "* `area`: get the area of a polygon (`gdf.geometry.area`)\n",
    "* `centroid`: get the centroid of a polygon (`gdf.geometry.centroid`)\n",
    "* `x`: get the x coordinate of a point (`gdf.geometry.x`)\n",
    "* `y`: get the y coordinate of a point (`gdf.geometry.y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "* Occasionally, we may even use arrays, especially when the datasets get even larger but we have simple mathematical calculations\n",
    "* If we need to apply an exponential decay function to a distance column, we essentially want to multiple `distance` by some number\n",
    "* Since this exponential decay function is somewhat custom and requires us to write our own formula, we would extract the column as a series (`df.distance`) and multiply each value by some other number.\n",
    "* Even quicker is to use `numpy` with `distance_array = np.array(df.distance)` and get `exponential_array = distance_array*some_number`"
