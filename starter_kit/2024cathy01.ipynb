CSV files utilize a row-based storage format which is harder to compress, a reason why Parquets files are preferable for larger datasets. Parquet files are faster to read than CSVs, as they have a higher querying speed and preserve datatypes (i.e. Number, Timestamps, Points). They are best for intermediate data storage and large datasets (1GB+) on most any on-disk storage. This file format is also good for passing dataframes between Python and R. A similar option is feather.</i>\n",
