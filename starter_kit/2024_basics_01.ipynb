The CSIS, which implements one of CAPTI’s key actions, is envisioned to be an investment framework through a data and performance-driven approach that guides transportation investments and decisions.\n",
    "* One way DDS is working on CSIS is by automating the scoring of projects using Python. We score each project based on how well they do in various categories, aka metrics such as Zero Emmission Vehicles, Vehicle Miles Traveled, and more. \n",
    "* While the values in we are working with today are all <i>fake</i>, the exercise really is based on actual datasets and assignments. "
