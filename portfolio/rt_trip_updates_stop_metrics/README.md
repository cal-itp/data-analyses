GTFS Real Time trip updates performance metrics, specifically the stop time update messages. 
Accurate and reliable information should be provided to transit users for journey planning. These performance metrics provide insights into:
* availability and completeness of RT - is there information available for users?
* prediction inconsistency - how much are predictions changing from minute to minute as the bus approaches time of arrival?
* prediction reliability and accuracy - are these predictions accurate (when compared to our estimated actual time of arrival)?
