# NTD Monthly Ridership by RTPA

Provide CalSTA with NTD Monthly Ridership by each regional transportation planning authority (RTPA).

This report shows general ridership trends by transit agency, mode, and type of service. Reported unlinked passenger trips are reported, as well as the change from the prior year. For example, July 2023's change would be the change in July 2023's reported values against July 2022's reported values.
