GTFS shapes provides the route alignment path. Multiple trips may share the same shape, with a route typically associated with multiple shapes. Shapes are cut into segments at stop positions (stop_id-stop_sequence combination). A `stop segment` refers to the portion of shapes between the prior stop and the current stop. Vehicle positions are spatially joined to 35 meter buffered segments. Within each segment-trip, the first and last vehicle position observed are used to calculate the speed. Since multiple trips may occur over a segment each day, the multiple trip speeds provide a distribution. From this distribution, the 20th percentile, 50th percentile (median), and 80th percentile speeds are calculated. For all day speed metrics, all trips are used. For peak speed metrics, only trips with start times between 7 - 9:59 AM and 4 - 7:59 PM are used to find the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile metrics. Data processing notes: (a) GTFS RT trips whose vehicle position timestamps span 10 minutes or less are dropped. Incomplete data would lead to unreliable estimates of speed at the granularity we need. (b) Segment-trip speeds of over 70 mph are excluded. These are erroneously calculated as transit does not typically reach those speeds.
