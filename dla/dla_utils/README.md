These shared utils include general charting functions as well as DLA related aggregation functions. Modeled off _shared_utils, these functions can be accessed across directories. 

## Getting Started

1. In terminal, change directory into `_dla_utils`: `cd data-analyses/dla/dla_utils`
1. Run the make command to further do the `pip install` and `conda install`: `make setup_env`
1. Do work in your project-subfolder. Ex: `cd ../dla/reports`
1. Within Jupyter Notebook or script: `from dla_utils import _dla_utils`
