# Introduction

Analysis of grants provided through the Division of Local Assistance.

The Division of Local Assistance (DLA) oversees funding for local agency transportation projects and services. This funding comes from both Federal and State sources and goes towards projects throughout the state. Through data analysis of the obligated fund data ([E-76](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/local-assistance/reports/e-76-obligated)), we can look into where funds are located and identify geographies of interest, the amount of funds obligated and what type of projects the funds are used for.

This is currently an example of static, hosted reports built on top of
parameterized Jupyter notebooks.
