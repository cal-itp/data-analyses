# Real Time Information Metrics POC

Proof of concept for performance metrics of GTFS RT predictions.

Refer to [Makefile](./Makefile) for data cleaning steps.

Demo workability, feasibility, understandability, interpretability of 4 metrics in notebooks:
1. [Update Completeness](./01_update_completeness.ipynb)
1. [Expected Wait Time](./02_expected_wait_time.ipynb)
1. [Prediction Inconsistency](./03_prediction_inconsistency.ipynb)
1. [Reliably Prediction Accuracy](./04_reliable_prediction_accuracy.ipynb)
