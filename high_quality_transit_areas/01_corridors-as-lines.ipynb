    "# Demo: backing out HQ transit corridors as lines\n",

    "Conservation Biology Institute working with Governor's Office of Planning and Research to develop a CEQA Site Check.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main hurdle**: Screening parcels using two different buffer ranges (1/2-mile and 1/4-mile) specific to HQ corridors, rather than the single buffer range in your CA HQ Transit Areas dataset (polygons). We do this because they filter parcels into different qualification zones depending on the particular CEQA exemption for streamlining of housing development.\n",
    "<br>**What they have**: an existing modeling workflow to buffer and build out rest of the separate layers.\n",
    "<br>**What they want**: linestrings they can buffer themselves.\n",
    "<br>**Solution**: demo how to get linestrings for HQ areas (polygons) using only open data portal products.\n"
