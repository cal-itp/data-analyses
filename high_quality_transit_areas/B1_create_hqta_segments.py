"""
Draw bus corridors (routes -> segments) across all operators.

Use difference instead of symmetric difference, and we'll
end up with similar results, since we cut segments
across both direction == 0 and direction == 1 now.

Cannot use symmetric difference unless we downgrade pandas to 1.1.3
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/414317/gpd-overlay-throws-intcastingnanerror.
Too complicated to change between pandas versions.

Takes 8 min to run 
- down from 1 hr in v2 
- down from several hours v1

TODO: speed up geography_utils.cut_segments to be faster.
7.5 min is spent on this step.
