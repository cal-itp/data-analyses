# High Quality Transit Corridor & Major Bus Stop Explorer

A resource for exploring how we classify HQ Corridors and Major Transit Stops based on bus frequencies and intersections. Also see our [README](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-analyses/tree/main/high_quality_transit_areas#readme) and [technical_notes](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-analyses/blob/main/high_quality_transit_areas/technical_notes.md).

## Who We Are

This website was created by the [California Department of Transportation](https://dot.ca.gov/)'s Division of Data and Digital Services. We are a group of data analysts and scientists who analyze transportation data, such as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, or data from funding programs such as the Active Transportation Program. Our goal is to transform messy and indecipherable original datasets into usable, customer-friendly products to better the transportation landscape. For more of our work, visit our [portfolio](https://https://analysis.dds.dot.ca.gov/).
