    "1. Get a list of unique feeds where at least one route_directions pair qualifies to evaluate.\n",
    "1. Get stop_times filtered to that feed, and filter that to stops that only qualify with multiple routes, and route directions that pair with at least one other route_direction. Do not consider pairs between the same route in one direction and the same route in the opposite direction.\n",
    "1. After that filtering, check again if stop_times includes the minimum frequency to qualify at each stop. Exclude stops where it doesn't.\n",
    "1. Then... evaluate which route_directions can be aggregated at each remaining stop. From the full list of route_directions (sorted by frequency) serving the stop, use `list(itertools.combinations(this_stop_route_dirs, 2))` to get each unique pair of route_directions. Check each of those unique pairs to see if it meets the `SHARED_STOP_THRESHOLD`. If they all do, keep all stop_times entries for that stop, different route_directions can be aggregated together at that stop. If any do not, remove the least frequent route_direction and try again, until a subset passes (only keep stop_times for that subset) or until all are eliminated.
