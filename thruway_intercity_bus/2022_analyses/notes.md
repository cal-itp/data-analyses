* MST runs longer routes
* Eastern Sierra Transit (Lancaster to Reno)
* Sonoma County Transit...or is it Golden Gate Transit 
* SolTrans

Also maybe grab a full week to get all the unique OD pairs

1. Follow Amtrak thruway (or same OD)
2. Don't follow Amtrak thruway but go longer distance
Longer route (> certain distance) get at Eastern Sierra
3. Long routes that travel on SHN on extended period of time
