    "# Spatial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression (and prediction more generally) provides us a perfect case to examine how spatial structure can help us understand and analyze our data. In this chapter, we discuss how spatial structure can be used to both validate and improve prediction algorithms, focusing on linear regression specifically. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *What* is spatial regression and *why* should I care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, spatial structure helps regression models in one of two ways. \n",
    "The first (and most clear) way space can have an impact on our data is when the process *generating* the data is itself explicitly spatial.\n",
    "Here, think of something like the prices for single family homes. \n",
    "It's often the case that individuals pay a premium on their house price in order to live in a better school district for the same quality house. \n",
    "Alternatively, homes closer to noise or chemical polluters like waste water treatment plants, recycling facilities, or wide highways, may actually be cheaper than we would otherwise anticipate. \n",
    "In cases like asthma incidence, the locations individuals tend to travel to throughout the day, such as their places of work or recreation, may have more impact on their health than their residential addresses. \n",
    "In this case, it may be necessary to use data *from other sites* to predict the asthma incidence at a given site. \n",
    "Regardless of the specific case at play, here, *geography is a feature*: it directly helps us make predictions about outcomes *because those outcomes obtain from geographical processes*. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative (and more skeptical understanding) reluctantly acknowledges geography's instrumental value. \n",
    "Often, in the analysis of predictive methods and classifiers, we are interested in analyzing what we get wrong.\n",
    "This is common in econometrics; an analyst may be concerned that the model *systematically* mis-predicts some types of observations.\n",
    "If we know our model routinely performs poorly on a known set of observations or type of input, we might make a better model if we can account for this. \n",
    "Among other kinds of error diagnostics, geography provides us with an exceptionally-useful embedding to assess structure in our errors.\n",
    "Mapping classification/prediction error can help show whether or not there are *clusters of error* in our data.\n",
    "If we *know* that errors tend to be larger in some areas than in other areas (or if error is \"contagious\" between observations), then we might be able to exploit this structure to make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial structure in our errors might arise from when geography *should be* an attribute somehow, but we are not sure exactly how to include it in our model. \n",
    "They might also arise because there is some *other* feature whose omission causes the spatial patterns in the error we see; if this additional feature were included, the structure would disappear. \n",
    "Or, it might arise from the complex interactions and interdependencies between the features that we have chosen to use as predictors, resulting in intrinsic structure in mis-prediction. \n",
    "Most of the predictors we use in models of social processes contain *embodied* spatial information: patterning intrinsic to the feature that we get for free in the model. \n",
    "If we intend to or not, using a spatially-patterned predictor in a model can result in spatially-patterned errors; using more than one can amplify this effect. \n",
    "Thus, *regardless of whether or not the true process is explicitly geographic*, additional information about the spatial relationships between our observations or more information about nearby sites can make our predictions better. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we build space into the traditional regression framework. We begin with a standard linear regression model, devoid of any geographical reference. From there, we formalise space and spatial relationships in three main ways: first, encoding it in exogenous variables; second, through spatial heterogeneity, or as systematic variation of outcomes across space; third, as dependence, or through the effect associated to the characteristics of spatial neighbors. Throughout, we focus on the conceptual differences each approach entails rather than on the technical details.\n",

    "## Non-spatial regression, a (very) quick refresh\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss how to explicitly include space into the linear regression framework, let us show how basic regression can be carried out in Python, and how one can begin to interpret the results. By no means is this a formal and complete introduction to regression so, if that is what you are looking for, we recommend {cite}`Gelman_2006`, in particular chapters 3 and 4, which provide a fantastic, non-spatial introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of linear regression is to explain the variation in a given (*dependent*) variable as a linear function of a collection of other (*explanatory*) variables. For example, in our case, we may want to express the price of a house as a function of the number of bedrooms it has and whether it is a condominium or not. At the individual level, we can express this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_i = \\alpha + \\sum_k \\mathbf{X}_{ik}\\beta_k  + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_i$ is the AirBnB price of house $i$, and $X$ is a set of covariates that we use to explain such price (e.g. No. of bedrooms and condominium binary variable). $\\beta$ is a vector of parameters that give us information about in which way and to what extent each variable is related to the price, and $\\alpha$, the constant term, is the average house price when all the other variables are zero. The term $\\epsilon_i$ is usually referred to as \"error\" and captures elements that influence the price of a house but are not included in $X$. We can also express this relation in matrix form, excluding subindices for $i$, which yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\alpha + \\mathbf{X}\\beta + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A regression can be seen as a multivariate extension of bivariate correlations. Indeed, one way to interpret the $\\beta_k$ coefficients in the equation above is as the degree of correlation between the explanatory variable $k$ and the dependent variable, *keeping all the other explanatory variables constant*. When one calculates bivariate correlations, the coefficient of a variable is picking up the correlation between the variables, but it is also subsuming into it variation associated with other correlated variables -- also called confounding factors. Regression allows us to isolate the distinct effect that a single variable has on the dependent one, once we *control* for those other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically speaking, linear regressions in Python are rather streamlined and easy to work with. There are also several packages which will run them (e.g. `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `pysal`). We will import the `spreg` module in Pysal:"

Conversely, given a number of rooms, houses with more beds (i.e.. listings that are more \"crowded\") tend to go for cheaper, as it is the case for properties where one does not rent the entire house but only a room (`rt_Private_room`) or even shares it (`rt_Shared_room`). Of course, you might conceptually doubt the assumption that it is possible to *arbitrarily* change the number of beds within an AirBnB without eventually changing the number of people it accommodates, but methods to address these concerns using *interaction effects* won't be discussed here. \n",

    "Fortunately, there are nearly as many techniques, called *spatial regression* methods, that are designed to handle these sorts of structures.\n",
    "Spatial regression is about *explicitly* introducing space or geographical context into the statistical framework of a regression. \n",
    "Conceptually, we want to introduce space into our model whenever we think it plays an important role in the process we are interested in, or when space can act as a reasonable proxy for other factors we cannot but should include in our model. \n",
    "As an example of the former, we can imagine how houses at the seafront are probably more expensive than those in the second row, given their better views. \n",
    "To illustrate the latter, we can think of how the character of a neighborhood is important in determining the price of a house; however, it is very hard to identify and quantify \"character\" *per se,* although it might be easier to get at its spatial variation, hence a case of space as a proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial regression is a large field of development in the econometrics and statistics literatures. \n",
    "In this brief introduction, we will consider two related but very different processes that give rise to spatial effects: spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence. Before diving into them, we begin with another approach that introduces space in a regression model without modifying the model itself but rather creates spatially explicit independent variables. \n",

In this section, we will briefly present how to insert *spatial features*, or $X$ variables that are constructed from geographical relationships, in a standard linear model. We discuss spatial feature engineering extensively in [Chapter 12](12_feature_engineering), though, and the depth and extent of spatial feature engineering is difficult to overstate. Rather than detail, this section will show how spatially explicit variables you engineer can be \"plugged\" into a model to improve its performance or help you explain the underlying process of interest with more accuracy. \n",

    "One relevant proximity-driven variable that could influence our San Diego model is based on the listings proximity to Balboa Park. A common tourist destination, Balboa park is a central recreation hub for the city of San Diego, containing many museums and the San Diego zoo. Thus, it could be the case that people searching for AirBnBs in San Diego are willing to pay a premium to live closer to the park. If this were true *and* we omitted this from our model, we may indeed see a significant spatial pattern caused by this distance decay effect. \n",

    "### Spatial Heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have assumed that our proximity variable might stand in for a difficult-to-measure premium individuals pay when they're close to a recreational zone (a park in this case). Our approach in that case was to incorporate space through a very specific channel, that is the distance to an amenity we thought might be influencing the final price. However, not all neighborhoods have the same house prices; some neighborhoods may be systematically more expensive than others, regardless of their proximity to Balboa Park. If this is our case, we need some way to account for the fact that each neighborhood may experience these kinds of *gestalt*, unique effects. One way to do this is by capturing *spatial heterogeneity*. At its most basic, *spatial heterogeneity* means that parts of the model may vary systematically with geography, change in different places. For example, changes to the intercept, $\\alpha$, may reflect the fact that different areas have different baseline exposures to a given process. Changes to the slope terms, $\\beta$, may indicate some kind of geographical mediating factor that makes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables vary across space, such as when a governmental policy is not consistently applied across jurisdictions. Finally, changes to the variance of the residuals, commonly denoted $\\sigma^2$, can introduce spatial heteroskedasticity. We deal with the first two in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Fixed Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature commonly refers to geographic variations of $\\alpha$ as \"spatial fixed effects\". To illustrate them, let us consider the house price example from the previous section. Sometimes, spatial fixed effects are said to capture \"space as a proxy\", in that we know the outcome varies over space, we (hope to) know the pattern it follows (in our case, by neighbourhood) and we can thus incorporate that knowledge into the model by letting $\\alpha$ vary accordingly. The rationale goes as follows. Given we are only including a few explanatory variables in the model, it is likely we are missing some important factors that play a role at determining the price at which a house is sold. Some of them, however, are likely to vary systematically over space (e.g. different neighborhood characteristics). If that is the case, we can control for those unobserved factors by using traditional binary variables but basing their creation on a spatial rule. For example, let us include a binary variable for every neighborhood, indicating whether a given house is located within such area (`1`) or not (`0`). Mathematically, we are now fitting the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log{P_i} = \\alpha_r + \\sum_k \\mathbf{X}_{ik}\\beta_k  + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the main difference is that we are now allowing the constant term, $\\alpha$, to vary by neighborhood $r$, $\\alpha_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmatically, we will show two different ways we can estimate this: one,\n",
    "using `statsmodels`; and two, with `spreg`. First, we will use `statsmodels`, the econometrician's toolbox in Python. "

Remember that the interpretation of $\\beta_k$ is the effect of variable $k$, *given all the other explanatory variables included remain constant*. By including a single variable for each area, we are effectively forcing the model to compare as equal only house prices that share the same value for each variable; or, in other words, only houses located within the same area. Introducing FE affords a higher degree of isolation of the effects of the variables we introduce in the model because we can control for unobserved effects that align spatially with the distribution of the FE introduced (by neighborhood, in our case).

    "At the core of estimating spatial FEs is the idea that, instead of assuming the dependent variable behaves uniformly over space, there are systematic effects following a geographical pattern that affect its behavior. In other words, spatial FEs introduce econometrically the notion of spatial heterogeneity. They do this in the simplest possible form: by allowing the constant term to vary geographically. The other elements of the regression are left untouched and hence apply uniformly across space. The idea of spatial regimes (SRs) is to generalize the spatial FE approach to allow not only the constant term to vary but also any other explanatory variable. This implies that the equation we will be estimating is:\n",

There are however many other advanced spatial regression methods routinely used in statistics, data science, and applied analysis. For example, Generalized Additive Models {cite}`Gibbons_2015,Wood_2006` haven been used to apply spatial kernel smoothing directly within a regression function. Other similar smoothing methods, such as spatial Gaussian process models {cite}`Brunsdon_2010` or Kriging, conceptualize the dependence between locations as smooth as well. Other methods in spatial regression that consider graph-based geographies (rather than distance/kernel effects) include variations on conditional autoregressive model, which examines spatial relationships at locations *conditional* on their surroundings, rather than as jointly co-emergent with them. Full coverage of these topics is beyond the scope of this book, however, though {cite}`Banerjee_2008` provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion. We have not covered these (and other existing ones) not because we do not think are important or useful, far from it, but because we consider them a bit more advanced than the level at which we wanted to pitch the chapter.\n",

    "Both the set of models we have introduced in here and others that exist but we have not covered share the feature of embedding space as a \"first class\" citizen in the regression framework. In all these cases, we conceptualise space (e.g. through a spatial weights matrix) and _modify_ the functional form of our original model in a way that recognises the location of its observations when generating predictions or inference. This approach results in modifications of the modelling framework to accommodate geography. In the next chapter, we discuss a different perspective to embed space in our modelling efforts. Rather than injecting space through the functional form, we will do it through the variables we use to explain/predict the outcome of interest. In this case, we will be using geography to _enrich_ our data _before_ it is passed through a modelling framework."

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One common kind of spatial econometric model is the \"Spatial Durbin Model,\" which combines the SLX model with the spatial lag model. Alternatively, the \"Spatial Durbin Error Model\" combines the SLX model with the spatial error model. Fit a Spatial Durbin variant of the spatial models fit in this chapter. \n",
    "    - Do these variants improve the model fit?\n",
    "    - What happens to the spatial autocorrelation parameters ($\\rho$, $\\lambda$) when the SLX term is added? Why might this occur?\n",
    "2. Fortunately for us, spatial error models recover the same estimates (asymptotically) as a typical OLS estimate, although their confidence intervals will change. Statistically, this occurs because OLS miscalculates when there is spatial correlation and/or spatial heteroskedasticity. How much do the confidence intervals change when the spatial error model is fit?\n",
    "3. One common justification for the SLX model (and the Spatial Durbin variants) is about *omitted, spatially-patterned variables*. That is, if an omitted variable is associated with the included variables *and* is spatially-patterned, then we can use the spatial structure of our existing variables to mimic the omitted variable. In our spatial lag model, \n",
    "    - what variables might we be missing that are important to predict the price of an AirBnB?\n",
    "    - would these omitted variables have a similar spatial pattern to our included variables? why or why not? \n",
    "4. Where *spatial* regression models generally focus on how nearby observations are similar to one another, *platial* models focus on how observations in the same spatial group are similar to one another. These are often dealt with using multilevel or spatial mixed-effect models. When do these two ideas work together well? And, when might these disagree?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following discussions are a bit challenging, but reflect extra enhancements to the discussions in the chapter that may solidify or enhance an advanced understanding of the material.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The random coast\n",
    "In the section analyzing our naive model residuals, we ran a classic two-sample $t$-test to identify whether or not our coastal and not-coastal residential districts tended to have the same prediction errors. Often, though, it's better to use straightforward, data-driven testing and simulation methods than assuming that the mathematical assumptions of the $t$-statistic are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we can shuffle our assignments to coast and not-coast, and check whether or not there are differences in the distributions of the *observed* residual distributions and random distributions. In this way, we shuffle the observations that are on the coast, and plot the resulting cumulative distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we do this; running 100 simulated re-assignments of districts to either \"coast\" or \"not coast,\" and comparing the distributions of randomly-assigned residuals to the observed distributions of residuals. Further, we do this plotting by the *empirical cumulative density function*, not the histogram directly. This is because the *empirical cumulative density function* is usually easier to examine visually, especially for subtle differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the black lines represent our simulations, and the colored patches below them represents the observed distribution of residuals. If the black lines tend to be on the left of the colored patch, then, the simulations (where prediction error is totally random with respect to our categories of \"coastal\" and \"not coastal\") tend to have more negative residuals than our actual model. If the black lines tend to be on the right, then they tend to have more positive residuals. As a refresher, positive residuals mean that our model is under-predicting, and negative residuals mean that our model is over-predicting. Below, our simulations provide direct evidence for the claim that our model may be systematically under-predicting coastal price and over-predicting non-coastal prices. "

    "Further, it might be the case that spatial dependence in our mis-predictions only matters for sites that are extremely close to one another, and decays quickly with distance. \n",
    "To investigate this, we can examine the correlation between each sites' residual and the *average* of the $k$th nearest neighbors' residuals, increasing $k$ until the estimate stabilizes. \n",
    "This main idea is central to the geostatistical concept, the *correlogram*, which gives the correlation between sites of an attribute being studied as distance increases.\n",

    "One quick way to check whether or not what we've seen is *unique* or *significant* is to compare it to what happens when we just assign neighbors randomly. \n",
    "If what we observe is substantially different from what emerges when neighbors are random, then the structure of the neighbors embeds a structure in the residuals. \n",
    "We won't spend too much time on this theory specifically, but we can quickly and efficiently compute the correlation between our observed residuals and the spatial lag of an increasing $k$-nearest neighbor set:"

    "Clearly, the two curves are different. The observed correlation reaches a peak around $r=.34$ when around 20 nearest listings are used. This means that adding more than 20 nearest neighbors does not significantly change the correlation in the residuals. Further, the lowest correlation is for the single nearest neighbor, and correlation rapidly increases as more neighbors are added close to the listing. Thus, this means that there does appear to be an unmeasured spatial structure in the residuals, since they are more similar to one another when they are near than when they are far apart. Further, while it's not shown here (since computationally, it becomes intractable), as the number of nearest neighbors gets very large (approaching the number of observations in the dataset), the average of the $k$th nearest neighbors' residuals goes to zero, the global average of residuals. This means that the correlation of the residuals and a vector that is nearly constant begins to approach zero. \n",

    "The null correlations, however, use randomly-chosen neighbors (without reassignment).\n",
    "Thus, since sampling is truly random in this case, each average of $k$ randomly-chosen neighbors is usually zero (the global mean). \n",
    "So, the correlation between the observed residual and the average of $k$ randomly-chosen residuals is also usually zero. \n",
    "Thus, increasing the number of randomly-chosen neighbors does not significantly adjust the long-run average of zero.\n",
    "Taken together, we can conclude that there is distinct positive spatial dependence in the error. \n",
    "This means that our over- and under-predictions are likely to cluster. "
