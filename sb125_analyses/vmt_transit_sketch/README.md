# Notebook Order

Will script-ify at some point. Notebooks use local paths for now but source data also available in GCS.

* read_process_data (includes vmt reduction/transit increase assumption)
* stops_by_tract (join warehouse stops/feeds to tracts)
* ntd
* regional_summary (compare with ntd data at uza level)
* analyze_visualize (maps, other quick exercises)
