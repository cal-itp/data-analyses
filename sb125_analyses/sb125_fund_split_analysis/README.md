 # SB125 Fund Split Analysis
As a condition of receiving SB125 (TIRCP and ZETCP programs) funds, RTPAs are required to complete an Initial Allocation Package describing their full four-year plan for use of these formulaic funds.

Agencies or RTPAs are requried to submit a summary Excel table (`SB 125 Fund Request.xlsx`) that explains the proposed uses of TIRCP and ZETCP funds by fiscal year of availability. This table is subdivided between funding for capital projects and funding for operations expenses, with each project and its implementing agency specifically identified, and each operator that will receive operations funding also specifically identified. 

This analysis aims to answer the question of "of all the fund request tables received, how much money is allocated to operating expenses and capital projects?"

Answering these questions will help inform CalSTA, Caltrans and other stakeholders of how agencies plan to use these funds to fulfill the objectives of SB125 and transform transit in California.

## Who We Are
We want our audience to understand who we are and why our expertise and research should be trusted. Here is a blurb you can lift. 

This website was created by the [California Department of Transportation](https://dot.ca.gov/)'s Division of Data and Digital Services. We are a group of data analysts and scientists who analyze transportation data, such as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, or data from funding programs such as the Active Transportation Program. Our goal is to transform messy and indecipherable original datasets into usable, customer-friendly products to better the transportation landscape.
