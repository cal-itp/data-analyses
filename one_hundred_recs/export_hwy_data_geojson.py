"""
Save hwy related outputs in GCS for sharing.

There are 2 source datasets that need to be filtered for each district.
* `transit-on-shn` uses 5 mile segment
* `transit-desert` uses 10 mile segment.
* `better_bus_utils` adds on the `caltrans_district` column...use `District` or `caltrans_district`?
* since hwy_segment_id appears in both, just rename it to 5 mile or 10 mile id so that it's clear for exports
