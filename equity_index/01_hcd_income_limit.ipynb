El Camino Avenue, Suite 500\\nSacramento, CA 95833\\n(916) 263-2911 / FAX (916) 263-7453\\nwww.hcd.ca.gov\\nMay 9, 2024\\nMEMORANDUM FOR: Interested Parties\\nFROM: Megan Kirkeby, Deputy Director\\nDivision of Housing Policy Development\\nSUBJECT: 2024 State Income Limits\\nAttached are briefing materials and 2024 State Income Limits that are now in effect, replacing the\\nprevious 2023 State Income Limits. Income limits reflect updated median income and household\\nincome levels for acutely low -, extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income\\nhouseholds for California’s 58 counties. The 2024 State Income Limits are on the Department of\\nHousing and Community Development (HCD) website at https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-\\nfunding/income-limits/state-and-federal-income-rent-and-loan-value-limits.\\nState Income Limits apply to designated programs, are used to determine applicant eligibility\\n(based on the level of household income) and may be used to calculate affordable housing costs\\nfor applicable housing assistance programs. Use of State Income Limits are subject to a\\nparticular program’s definition of income, family, family size, effective dates, and other factors. In\\naddition, definitions applicable to income categories, criteria, and geographic areas sometimes\\ndiffer depending on the funding source and program, resulting in some programs using other\\nincome limits.\\nThe attached briefing materials detail California’s 2024 State Income Limits and were updated\\nbased on: (1) changes to income limits the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\\n(HUD) released on April 1, 2024, for its Public Housing, Section 8, Section 202, and Section 811\\nprograms; and (2) adjustments HCD made based on State statutory provisions and its 2013 Hold\\nHarmless (HH) Policy.\\nFor questions concerning State Income Limits, please see the Questions and Answers on page 5\\nor contact StateIncomeLimits@hcd.ca.gov.2024 State Income Limits Briefing Materials\\nCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 6932\\nOverview\\nThe Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), pursuant to Health & Safety Code\\nSection 50093(c), must file updates to its State Income Limits with the Office of Administrative Law.\\nHCD annually updates these income limits based on U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\\nDevelopment (HUD) revisions to the Public Housing and Section 8 Income Limits that HUD most\\nrecently released on April 1, 2024.\\nHUD annually updates its Public Housing and Section 8 Income Limits to reflect changes in median\\nfamily income levels for different size households and income limits for extremely low-, very low-, and\\nlow-income households. HCD, pursuant to statutory provisions, makes the following additional revisions:\\n(1) if necessary, increases a county’s area median income to equal California’s non-metropolitan\\nmedian income, (2) adjusts Area Median Income (AMI) and household income category levels to not\\nresult in any year-over-year decrease for any year after 2009 pursuant to HCD’s February 2013 Hold\\nHarmless (HH) Policy. (HCD’s HH Policy was implemented to replace HUD’s HH Policy, discontinued in\\n2009, to ensure income limits and area median income levels do not fall below a prior year’s highest\\nlevel), and (3) determines income limits for California’s acutely low-income and moderate-income\\ncategories.\\nFollowing are brief summaries of technical methodologies used by HUD and HCD in updating income\\nlimits for different household income categories. For additional information, please refer to HUD’s\\nbriefing materials at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il//il24/IncomeLimitsMethodology-\\nFY24.pdf.\\nHUD Methodology\\nHUD Public Housing and Section 8 Income Limits begin with the production of median family incomes.\\nHUD uses the Section 8 program’s Fair Market Rent (FMR) area definitions in developing median\\nincomes, which means developing median incomes for each metropolitan area, parts of some\\nmetropolitan areas, and each non-metropolitan county. The 2024 FMR area definitions for California are\\nunchanged from last year. HUD calculates Income Limits for every FMR area with adjustments for\\nfamily size and for areas with unusually high or low family income or housing-cost-to-income\\nrelationships.\\nExtremely Low-Income\\nIn determining the extremely low-income limit, HUD uses the Federal Poverty Guidelines, published by\\nthe Department of Health and Human Services. The Federal Poverty Guidelines are a simplified version\\nof the Federal Poverty Thresholds used for administrative purposes — for instance, determining\\nfinancial eligibility for certain federal programs. HUD compares the appropriate poverty guideline with\\n60% of the very low-income limit and chooses the greater of the two as the extremely low-income limit.\\nThe value may not exceed the very low-income level.\\nVery Low-Income\\nThe very low-income limits are the basis for the extremely low- and low-income limits. The very low-\\nincome limit typically reflects 50 percent of median family income (MFI), and HUD's MFI figure generally\\nequals two times HUD's 4-person very low-income limit. However, HUD may adjust the very low-income\\nlimit for an area or county to account for conditions that warrant special considerations. As such, the\\nvery low-income limit may not always equal 50% MFI.\\nLow-Income\\nIn general, most low-income limits represent the higher level of: (1) 80 percent of MFI or, (2) 80 percent\\nof state non-metropolitan median family income. However, due to adjustments that HUD sometimes\\nmakes to the very low-income limit, strictly calculating low-income limits as 80 percent of MFI could\\nPage 2 of 52024 State Income Limits Briefing Materials\\nCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 6932\\nproduce unintended anomalies inconsistent with statutory intent (e.g., very low-income limits being\\nhigher than low-income limits). Therefore, HUD’s briefing materials specify that, with some exceptions,\\nthe low-income limit reflect 160 percent of the very low-income limit. HUD may apply additional\\nadjustments to areas with unusually high or low housing-costs-to-income relationships and for other\\nreasons. This can result in low-income limits exceeding MFI in certain counties.\\nMedian Family Income/Area Median Income\\nHUD references and estimates the MFI in calculating the income limits. California law and State Income\\nLimits reference AMI that, pursuant to Health & Safety Code section 50093(c), means the MFI of a\\ngeographic area of the State, as estimated annually by HUD for its Section 8 Program.\\nIn estimating FY 2024 median family incomes, HUD uses median family income data (as opposed to\\nmedian household income data) from the 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) as calculated by the\\nCensus Bureau. The Census Bureau produces two types of ACS estimates: the “one-year” data, which\\nrepresent estimates as of 2022; and the “five-year” data, which represent estimates as of 2018-2022\\n(but are inflated to 2022 dollars). HUD requires special tabulations of the ACS to match its custom\\nHMFA definitions described above.\\nHUD uses the 2022 ACS median family income data (as opposed to household income data) as the\\nbasis of FY 2024 Income Limits for all areas of California. HUD uses an inflation forecast from the\\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO) in updating ACS estimates. For FY 2024, CBO has produced a\\nforecast CPI of 310.683, which divided by annual 2022 of 292.613 is 1.062 (an increase of 6.2 percent).\\nFor additional information on MFI’s please see HUD’s briefing materials at\\nhttps://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il24/Medians-Methodology-FY24.pdf.\\nAdjustment Calculations\\nHUD may apply adjustments to areas with unusually high or low family income, uneven housing-cost-to-\\nincome relationship, or other reasons. For example, HUD applies an increase if the four-person very\\nlow-income limit would otherwise be less than the amount at which 35 percent of it equals 85 percent of\\nthe annualized two-bedroom Section 8 FMR (or 40th percentile rent in 50th percentile FMR areas). The\\npurpose is to increase the income limit for areas where rental-housing costs are unusually high in\\nrelation to the median income. In certain cases, HUD also applies an adjustment to the income limits\\nbased on the state non-metropolitan median family income level.\\nIn addition, HUD restricts adjustments, so income limits do not increase more than five percent of the\\nprevious year's very low-income figure OR twice the increase in the national MFI as measured by the\\nACS with an absolute cap of 10 percent, whichever is greater. For 2024, the annualized change is\\nmeasured by the ACS from 2021 to 2022. Twice this change is approximately 14.8 percent, which is\\ngreater than the 10 percent absolute cap. So, for FY 2024, the income limits “cap” is 10 percent. HUD\\nfirst announced this methodology on January 10, 2024 in a Federal Register Notice. The cap and floor\\nrules do not apply to the extremely low-income limits.\\nPlease refer to HUD briefing materials for additional information on the adjustment calculations.\\nIncome Limit Calculations for Household Sizes Other Than 4-Persons\\nThe income limit statute requires adjustments for family size. The legislative history and conference\\ncommittee report indicates that Congress intended that income limits should be higher for larger families\\nand lower for smaller families. The same family size adjustments apply to all income limits, except\\nextremely low-income limits, which are set at the poverty income threshold. They are as follows:\\nNumber of Persons in Household: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\nAdjustments: 70% 80% 90% Base 108% 116% 124% 132%\\nPage 3 of 52024 State Income Limits Briefing Materials\\nCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 6932\\nIncome Limit Calculations for Household Sizes Greater Than 8-Persons\\nFor households of more than eight persons, refer to the formula at the end of the table for 2024 Income\\nLimits. Due to the adjustments HUD can make to income limits in a given county, table data should be\\nthe only method used to determine program eligibility. Arithmetic calculations are applicable only when a\\nhousehold has more than eight members. New for FY 2024, family size-adjusted income limits are\\nretested for compliance with the cap and floor rules. Please refer to HUD’s briefing material for\\nadditional information on family size adjustments.\\nHCD Methodology\\nState law (see, e.g., Health & Safety Code section 50093) prescribes the methodology HCD uses to\\nupdate the State Income Limits. HCD utilizes HUD’s Public Housing and Section 8 Income Limits.\\nHCD’s methodology involves: (1) if necessary, increasing a county’s median income established by\\nHUD to equal California’s non-metropolitan county median income determined by HUD, (2) applying\\nHCD’s HH Policy, in effect since 2013, to not allow decreases in AMI levels and household income\\ncategory levels, (3) applying to the median income the same family size adjustments HUD applies to the\\nincome limits, (4) determining income limit levels applicable to California’s acutely low-income\\nhouseholds defined by law as household income not exceeding 15 percent of county AMI, and (5)\\ndetermining income limit levels applicable to California’s moderate-income households defined by law\\nas household income not exceeding 120 percent of county AMI.\\nArea Median Income and Income Category Levels\\nHCD, pursuant to federal and State law, adjusts median income levels for all counties so they are not\\nless than the non-metropolitan county median income established by HUD ($87,900 for 2024). Next,\\nHCD applies its HH Policy to ensure AMI and income limits for all household income categories do not\\nfall below any level achieved in the prior year. Health and Safety Code section 50093 requires HCD to\\nadjust the AMI for family size in accordance with adjustment factors adopted by HUD and illustrated on\\nthe previous page. This establishes that the MFI published by HUD equals the four-person AMI for\\nCalifornia counties.\\nAcutely low-Income Levels\\nBeginning in 2022, Health and Safety Code section 50063.5 established California’s acutely low-income\\nhousehold levels. After calculating the 4-person area median income (AMI) level as previously\\ndescribed, HCD sets the maximum acutely low-income limit to equal 15 percent of the county’s AMI,\\nadjusted for family size.\\nModerate-Income Levels\\nHCD is responsible for establishing California’s moderate-income limit levels. After calculating the 4-\\nperson AMI level as previously described, HCD sets the maximum moderate-income limit to equal 120\\npercent of the county’s AMI, adjusted for family size.\\nApplicability of California’s Official State Income Limits\\nApplicability of the State Income Limits are subject to particular programs as program definitions of\\nfactors such as income, family, and household size vary. Some programs, such as Multifamily Tax\\nSubsidy Projects (MTSPs), use different income limits. For MTSPs, separate income limits apply per\\nprovisions of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008 (Public Law 110-289). Income\\nlimits for MTSPs are used to determine qualification levels as well as set maximum rental rates for\\nprojects funded with tax credits authorized under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). In\\naddition, MTSP income limits apply to projects financed with tax-exempt housing bonds issued to\\nprovide qualified residential rental development under Section 142 of the Code. These income limits are\\navailable at http://www.huduser.org/datasets/mtsp.html.\\nPage 4 of 52024 State Income Limits Briefing Materials\\nCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 6932\\nQuestions and Answers\\nIn Los Angeles, as well as several other counties in the state, why does the very low-income limit\\nnot equal 50% of AMI (or the low-income limit not equal 80% of AMI)?\\nThere are many exceptions to the arithmetic calculation of income limits. These include adjustments for\\nhigh housing cost relative to income, the application of state nonmetropolitan income limits in low-income\\nareas, and national maximums in high-income areas. In Los Angeles County, as well as several\\nothers, the magnitude of these adjustments results in the low-income limit exceeding AMI. These\\nexceptions are detailed in the FY 2024 Income Limits Methodology\\nDocument, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il24/Medians-Methodology-FY24.pdf.\\nFor further information on the exact adjustments made to an individual area of the country, please see\\nHUD’s FY 2024 Income Limits Documentation System. The documentation system is available\\nat https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2024/select_Geography.odn. Once the area in question is\\nselected, a summary of the area’s median income, Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-\\nIncome Limits are displayed. Detailed calculations are obtained by selecting the relevant links.\\nWhy don’t the income limits for my area reflect recent gains?\\nAlthough HUD uses the most recent data available concerning local area incomes, there is still a lag\\nbetween when the data are collected and when the data are available for use. For example, FY 2024\\nIncome Limits are calculated using 2018-2022 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, and one-\\nyear 2022 data where possible. This is a two-year lag, so more current trends in median family income\\nlevels are not available.\\nHUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan\\ncounty. The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the ACS, table B19113 - MEDIAN\\nFAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. A Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast as published by\\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics is used in the trend factor calculation to bring the 2021 ACS data forward\\nto FY 2023.\\nFor additional details concerning the use of the ACS in HUD’s calculations of MFI, please see HUD’s FY\\n2024 Median Family Income methodology document,\\nat https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il23/Medians-Methodology-FY24.pdf\\nAdditionally, full documentation of all calculations for MFIs is available in the FY 2024 Median Family\\nIncome and the FY 2024 Income Limits Documentation System. These systems are available\\nat https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2024/select_Geography.odn\\nWhy didn’t the income limits for my county change from last year?\\nHCD’s 2013 Hold Harmless Policy likely prevented the income limits from decreasing from last year’s\\nlevels and has maintained them despite a decrease in median income and/or income limits published by\\nHUD.\\nWhy do the income limits or area median income for my county not match what was published by\\nHUD?\\nHCD adjusts each county’s AMI to at least equal the state non-metropolitan county median income, as\\npublished by HUD. Further, HCD’s 2013 Hold Harmless Policy prevents any decrease in income limits or\\nmedian family income published by HUD to be applied to State Income Limits.\\nPage 5 of 5Section 6932. 2024 Income
