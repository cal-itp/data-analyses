    "### Helpful Hints and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chaining\n",
    "Similar to **piping** in R, where you can pipe multiple operations in 1 line of code with `>>`, you can do a similar method of chaining in Python. There is also a `df.pipe` function, but that's slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make use of parentheses to do this. Also, use `df.assign` (see below) so you don't run into the `SettingWithCopyWarning`, which may pop up if you decide to subset your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assign \n",
    "You can create new columns in place, and the warning that comes up is mostly harmless. But, `assign` also lets you chain more operations after. [More clarification.](https://pythonguides.com/add-a-column-to-a-dataframe-in-python-pandas/)\n",
    "```\n",
    "states_clean = (states_clean\n",
    "    .assign(\n",
    "        # Strip leading or trailing blanks (slightly different than replace)\n",
    "        # Decide if you want to replace all blanks or just leading/trailing\n",
    "        Agency = (states_clean.Agency.str.strip()\n",
    "                .str.replace('(', '').str.replace(')', '')\n",
    "        ),\n",
    "        # Do something similar for City as above\n",
    "        City = states_clean.City.str.strip(),\n",
    "        # Replace blanks with nothing\n",
    "        State = states_clean.State.str.replace(' ', '')\n",
    "    ).astype({\n",
    "        \"Population\": int, \n",
    "        \"Fare_Revenues\": int,\n",
    "    })\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, try it with a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for c in [\"Agency\", \"City\"]:\n",
    "    df[c] = (df[c].str.strip()\n",
    "            .str.replace('(', '')\n",
    "            .str.replace(')', '')\n",
    "            .astype(int)\n",
    "            )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `str.contains` with some special characters\n",
    "Use backslash `\\` to \"escape\". [StackOverflow explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48699907/error-unbalanced-parenthesis-while-checking-if-an-item-presents-in-a-pandas-d)\n",
    "`states_clean[states_clean.Fare_Revenues.str.contains(\"\\(\")]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merging\n",
    "If your merge results produces a `col_x` and `col_y`, add more columns to your list of merge columns, with `on = [\"col1\", \"col2\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use `isin` to filter by multiple conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "keep_me = [\"CA\", \"NY\", \"TX\"]\n",
    "df2 = df[df.State.isin(keep_me)]\n",
    "```"

    "### Additional Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subsetting columns: also write a line that does the same thing but selecting column names instead of `iloc`\n",
    "* analysis df...aggregation is incorrect\n",
    "    * either look at what is happening in one state\n",
    "    * Or, export it to Excel, and use formulas to understand what is happening when you do the groupby/agg\n",
    "    * make sure when you're selecting sum/mean/count/median/etc, you're selecting the right one and you fully understand what is happening OR you exclude it from groupby/agg and merge on a separate df that has the correct values\n",
    "* when you have `reset_index()` and an index column appears, try `reset_index(drop=True)` and see how that's different\n",
    "* good lambda function for calculating per capita metric\n",
    "* Chart changes: change colors for plot to be colors in `altair_utils`\n",
    "    * add the theme_538()\n",
    "    * play with labels on axes so they don't have underscores \n",
    "    * play with bar sizing and plot sizing\n",
    "* Make an additional chart normalizing by unlinked passenger trips instead of population. Repeat groupby/agg, and make sure any averages taken are weighted averages."
